# Project 3: Analuze AB Test Results

## Data 

The [data](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%203%20Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results/ab_data.csv) is provided by Udacity and consists of 294478 rows, each representing a specific visit to the website. The columns represent variables such as user id, time visited, control or treatment group, landing page, and whether the user converted. The goal of the project is to use A/B testing to see whether changes to website actually improved conversion rate of the visitors, in which they paid for the company's products

## Objectives

Use [Python with Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%203%20Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)
to do hypothesis testing to see whether the results were actually significant in increasing the conversion rate when comparing the old webpage versus the new webpage.
