# Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Data

The goal of this project is to gather, assess, clean, merge then visualize the data. Originally, the project had intended to use the Twitter API to request the tweets about the dogs, but due to an issue where I was denied assess to a Twitter developer account, I just used the [tweets data](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%204%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/tweet_json.txt) provided by Udacity. The [image predictions file](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%204%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/image_predictions.tsv) and [twitter archive file](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%204%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv) are also provided by Udacity.

## Objectives

Gather and assess: The 3 datasets are to be visually assessed, checked for nulls, duplicates and outliers in all of its variables.

Clean: Tidiness and cleanliness issues are defined, cleaned, then tested. Then the 3 datasets are merged. 

Visualize and report: Interesting insights are then visualized then all processes presented in [activity report](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%204%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/act_report.pdf) and [wrangling report](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%204%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/wrangle_report.pdf).
