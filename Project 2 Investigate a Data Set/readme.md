# Project 2: Investigate a dataset 

## Data

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) is provided by Kaggle.com and contains variables of different substances and measures found in wine and its rated quality.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to answer the question "What is it specifically that makes wine higher quality than others?". The project uses [Python with Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%202%20Investigate%20a%20Data%20Set/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb) to wrangle, assess, and clean the dataset, then use exploratory analysis and visualizations to answer the question. All findings are then presented with a [report](https://github.com/jmt7080/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%202%20Investigate%20a%20Data%20Set/Investigate_a_Dataset.pdf).
